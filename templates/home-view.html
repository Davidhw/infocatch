Welcome to InfoCatch, a service that, once a day, sends you an offline-viewable collection of the web content you've expressed interest in. 

To begin, enter a url into the box below.


<form action="/subscribe/" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ urlForm }}
</form>

<br>
This site is still being developed. As such, rather than delivering content, it just prints the selected content's url and xpath below. It also does not yet have a notion of multiple users.
